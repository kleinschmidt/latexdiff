\begin{document}

Here's some text, followed by a very important reference
\cite<here I feel obligated to cite>[even though it's not really
necessary]{small}.  Then a bit more text, with another reference
\cite{small} that I'll probably remove later.

Next a new paragraph \cite{big}.  Again, \citeA{big} claims XYZ
although we're not really sure why.
